Changes made after LemonTea abandoned this campaign


version 0.5.2
-------------

Made it so that every unit has its own ID. So that after a saveload every unit is really on the map. Bug reported by taptap.


version 0.6.0
-------------

	"06_Emerging_from_the_Depths":
Changed the map, made it so that the player can cross the tunnels in 40 turns instead of 80 like it was before.
Animated the wall-breakthrough's.
Added Dwarvish Scouts and Dwarvish Guardsman to the enemies recruitlist.


version 0.6.1
-------------

	"13_For_Auld_Lang_Syne"
Resized the map, so the player can reach the Wose a bit faster.
Changed the AI, so the Wose leader gets a bit protection.


version 0.6.2
-------------

Added information about the carry-over system to the objectives
