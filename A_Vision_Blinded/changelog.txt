Changes made after LemonTea abandoned this campaign


version 0.5.2
-------------

Made it so that every unit has its own ID. So that after a saveload every unit is really on the map. Bug reported by taptap.


version 0.6.0
-------------

	"06_Emerging_from_the_Depths":
Changed the map, made it so that the player can cross the tunnels in 40 turns instead of 80 like it was before.
Animated the wall-breakthrough's.
Added Dwarvish Scouts and Dwarvish Guardsman to the enemies recruitlist.
